# Project Nutrition

Project week 16 @ Technigo Bootcamp was a pair programming project where we were supposed to build an app in React and Redux, using the Open Food Facts API and the camera as a barcode scanner. We chose to make an app that scans your food product and tells you if it is cheese or not.

## The problem

We created a Redux store and reducers to be able to store product information of the scanned product using useDispatch and retreive the information we wanted to display using useSelector. We fetched data from the API in a thunk. The data from the API is shown in the product component. We pair-programmed using the VS Live Share extension, taking turns to code.
If we had more time we would incorporate React Router and make a loading indicator.
